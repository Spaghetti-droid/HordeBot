# HordeBot

A discord bot.
Current functionalities:
  - Roll dice and calculate mathematical expressions
  - Choose randomly between a set of options
  
 In order to make this work, you'll need the python-commons package on your PYTHONPATH. You'll also need to store a token in the same directory as horde_bot.py.
