# HordeBot

A discord bot.
Current functionalities:
  - Roll dice and calculate mathematical expressions
  - Choose randomly between a set of options
  
 You'll need the Spaghetti-droid/python-commons package on your PYTHONPATH to make this work (see https://github.com/Spaghetti-droid/python-commons). 
 You'll also need to store a file named horde_bot.token containing the token you'll be using to connect in the same directory as horde_bot.py.
